  <div class="tomy">Ella,</div><br>
  Since last time, I have genuinely been making an effort to express my sincerity to you.<br>
  It may sound a bit confusing, but it's the truth<br>
  I took the time to make this letter for you, but I understand that you may have other priorities and are focused elsewhere.<br>
  This one serves as an expression of admiration. I truly admire your femininity, your personality, and your kindness.<br>
  I haven't actually felt any of this before. I chose to be alone, and I don't believe in this 'love' thing. But I still don't know what happened that day we talked. I've changed a lot.<br>
  I'm here for the second time, hoping for your response. maybe you feel the same or maybe not, and that's okayâ€”we're still cool. However, I hope you can give this a chance.<br>
  I haven't been able to look for anybody else since that day.<br><br><br>
  You're my favorite chapter, and I can't wait to read the next.<br><br>
